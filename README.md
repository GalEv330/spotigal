  What to do on your phone/browser now:                                                                                                                                                       
  1. Open https://galev330.github.io/spotigal/                                                                                                                                                
  2. Do a hard refresh once (Cmd+Shift+R on desktop, or just close and reopen on iPhone)                                                                                                      
  3. The new SW installs, deletes walkplayer-v1, and loads the updated version                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  Going forward — every time you push code changes, also bump walkplayer-v2 → v3, etc. in sw.js. That's the signal to all browsers to dump their cache and get the new files.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 # WalkPlayer
